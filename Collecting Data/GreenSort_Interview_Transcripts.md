## **Interview Record 1**

**Participant:** Wanyou Guo, 28, Graphic Designer, lives in a city apartment.

**Interviewer:** Hello Wanyou Guo, thank you for joining. As we discussed, we're developing a waste-sorting app and want to hear about your experiences. Let's start with your current routine.

**Wanyou Guo:** Sure. Well, I have two bins in my kitchen – one for general waste and one for recycling. I try my best, but I'll be honest, it's not a perfect system.

**Interviewer:** How do you decide what goes where?

**Wanyou Guo:** I guess... general rules? Plastic bottles, cans, cardboard go in recycling. Food scraps, plastic wrappers, anything dirty goes in general waste. But then there's the grey area.

**Interviewer:** Can you give an example of a grey area for you?

**Wanyou Guo:** Yeah, like a pizza box. The top is clean cardboard, so that should be recyclable, right? But the bottom is all greasy. I usually just rip it in half and put the clean part in recycling and the greasy part in general waste. But I have no idea if that's actually correct or if I'm just contaminating the whole recycling bin.

**Interviewer:** That's a great, specific example. How confident are you overall?

**Wanyou Guo:** Maybe 70%? I'm confident about the obvious things, but it's the packaging that gets me. Those black plastic takeout containers? I heard they can't be recycled, but I see my neighbors putting them in the recycling all the time. So then I second-guess myself.

**Interviewer:** *(Follow-up)* Let's talk about that. What do you do when you're not sure?

**Wanyou Guo:** My first instinct is to just... Google it. But that's a pain. You have to type in the exact thing, and sometimes you get conflicting answers from different city websites. If I'm in a hurry, I might just toss it in general waste to be safe, which I know is bad.

**Interviewer:** So, if an app could solve that, what would be the ideal feature for you?

**Wanyou Guo:** Definitely a camera. Just point my phone at the item, like this takeout container, and it tells me instantly. Typing is okay, but sometimes you don't even know what the material is called.

**Interviewer:** How often do you think you'd use an app like that?

**Wanyou Guo:** At the beginning, all the time. Until I built up my knowledge. After that, probably just for the weird, one-off items. But if it had a collection day reminder? I'd use that weekly. I always forget which day is recycling day and which is compost.

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Wanyou Guo. That's very helpful.



## **Interview Record 2**

**Participant:** JianGuo Zheng, 65, Retired Teacher, lives in a suburban house.

**Interviewer:** JianGuo Zheng, thanks for your time. Could you describe your current waste disposal routine?

**JianGuo Zheng:** Of course. We're quite diligent, my wife and I. We have three bins: landfill, recycling, and green waste for the garden. I read the council's leaflet when it arrived, and we've been following that.

**Interviewer:** How do you decide on a tricky item?

**JianGuo Zheng:** Well, the leaflet is our bible. But it's not exhaustive. For instance, last week we had a broken lightbulb. It's glass, but it's not a bottle. Is it recycling? Is it hazardous waste? The leaflet didn't say.

**Interviewer:** *(Probing deeper)* And what did you end up doing?

**JianGuo Zheng:** I spent a good ten minutes looking online. Found a forum where people were arguing about it. In the end, I put it in the general waste. I felt a bit guilty, but I didn't want to risk it.

**Interviewer:** How does that kind of uncertainty make you feel about recycling programs?

**JianGuo Zheng:** A little frustrated, to be honest. We want to do the right thing, but they don't make it easy. The rules seem to change, and what's recyclable in one town isn't in the next. It feels like you need a degree in chemistry sometimes.

**Interviewer:** If an app could help, what would make you trust it?

**JianGuo Zheng:** It would have to be official. Endorsed by the local council or the environmental agency. Not just some random company. I'd want to know the information is authoritative and up-to-date for my specific area.

**Interviewer:** That's a key point. Would you use a feature where you could take a photo?

**JianGuo Zheng:** *(Hesitates)* I'm not sure. My phone camera is fine, but it seems... like a lot of fuss. I think I'd prefer to just type "broken lightbulb" and get a clear, written answer. Maybe with a picture from your app showing me exactly where it goes.

**Interviewer:** Understood. So clarity and local authority are crucial for you.

**JianGuo Zheng:** Exactly. If I trust the source, I'll use the tool.



## **Interview Record 3**

**Participant:** Wenjing Li, 31, Busy Mother of two young children.

**Interviewer:** Hi Wenjing Li, thanks for making the time. Let's jump in. What's your biggest challenge with waste sorting daily?

**Wenjing Li:** Time! Or the lack of it. Honestly, most of the time I'm sorting waste with a baby on my hip and a toddler asking for a snack. It's chaos. My main goal is to get it out of the house before it smells.

**Interviewer:** *(Empathizing)* That sounds tough. So, in that chaos, how do you make sorting decisions?

**Wenjing Li:** I do a quick mental scan. Is it obviously recyclable? In it goes. If it's messy, like a yogurt pouch, it's trash. The kids' toys are the worst. A toy car – is it the metal parts or the plastic parts? I don't have time to disassemble it. It all just goes in the general bin.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever been told you sorted something incorrectly?

**Wenjing Li:** *(Laughs)* Yes! Our waste collector once left a note on our recycling bin because I put in some disposable coffee cups. I thought they were paper! But apparently, they have a plastic lining. How was I supposed to know that? It was a little embarrassing.

**Interviewer:** So for an app to work for you, it would need to be...

**Wenjing Li:** Fast. Super, super fast. If I have to type a long description or wait for it to load, I'm already gone. A barcode scanner! That would be amazing. I'm already scanning groceries with my phone for prices. If I could just scan the packaging and it tells me, that would be a game-changer.

**Interviewer:** That's a fantastic suggestion we haven't heard much. How about reminders?

**Wenjing Li:** Oh, 100%. Push notifications for collection day. "Bin night tonight!" That would be a lifesaver. My brain is so full of kid-related stuff, the bins are always a last-minute panic.

**Interviewer:** Thank you, Wenjing Li. "Fast and barcode-scanning" is duly noted.



## **Interview Record 4**

**Participant:** Wenxuan Tan, 22, University Student, lives in a shared house.

**Interviewer:** Wenxuan Tan, tell me about your routine for disposing of waste.

**Wenxuan Tan:** Uh, we have bins in the kitchen. One for trash, one for recycling. To be honest, my housemates and I aren't super strict about it. We try, but it's a bit of a free-for-all.

**Interviewer:** What makes it a "free-for-all"?

**Wenxuan Tan:** Well, no one's really sure of the rules, and no one wants to be the "bin police." So if the recycling bin is full, sometimes stuff just ends up in the normal trash, even if it could be recycled. And vice versa.

**Interviewer:** Are there any items that consistently cause confusion in your house?

**Wenxuan Tan:** Yeah, for sure. Pizza boxes, like the other person probably said. Also, those plastic trays that meat comes on. Are they recyclable? They feel like plastic, but they're often kind of greasy. We usually just argue about it for a second and then someone chucks it in one bin or the other.

**Interviewer:** *(Follow-up)* How would you feel about an app that could settle those arguments instantly?

**Wenxuan Tan:** That would be sick, actually. Like a definitive source. We could just pull out our phones and be like, "See? I told you so." It would take the guesswork out.

**Interviewer:** What kind of interface would work best for that quick, social use?

**Wenxuan Tan:** Definitely the camera. It's the coolest and fastest way. Just point and shoot. Typing is fine, but the camera feels more like magic, you know? It's more engaging.

**Interviewer:** What would make you keep using it after the novelty wears off?

**Wenxuan Tan:** If it was, like, smart. If it learned what we commonly get wrong and gave us a little report, like "Hey, you guys are great with bottles, but you always mess up with paper cartons." Make it a bit competitive, maybe even compare our house's "recycling score" with other houses on our street? That would be motivating.

**Interviewer:** That's a very interesting idea – gamification and social proof. Thanks, Wenxuan Tan
