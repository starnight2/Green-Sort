In today’s society, waste sorting has become an essential part of promoting environmental protection and sustainable development. However, many residents still feel confused when faced with waste classification in their daily lives. Different cities—and even different neighborhoods—often have varying standards for sorting waste. Items such as milk tea cups, express packaging, and wet wipes can be difficult to categorize, leaving people unsure which bin to use. Incorrect waste disposal not only increases the cost of subsequent processing but also reduces overall recycling efficiency and weakens the effectiveness of environmental policies. Although many residents are environmentally conscious, they often lack a convenient tool to help them quickly make the right sorting decisions.

This is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed, as waste classification is not only a matter of personal habit but also a key factor in the overall environmental benefits to society. Accurate waste sorting can significantly improve resource recovery rates, reduce pollution from landfills and incineration, and thereby enhance air and water quality while promoting sustainable urban development. A smartphone application offers an effective solution to this problem, as it can integrate image recognition, geolocation, and instant query functions to provide users with real-time guidance in daily life. For example, when a user is unsure how to categorize an item, they can simply take a photo or enter a keyword, and the app will return the classification result along with region-specific recommendations. Compared with traditional websites, a mobile app is more convenient and intuitive, and it can encourage long-term participation in waste sorting through push notifications or eco-points systems—bridging individual actions with broader environmental goals.
